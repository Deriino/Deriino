- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Deriino
As of 2021 July 21st, this GitHub page is under construction -- there were things I had worked on in the past but had never uploaded here, which I didn't care about before because I happened to have a job before. Now that I am looking for a job, I will be filling out this page over the coming few weeks.

To reiterate, this GitHub is an <i>incomplete</i> list of stuff I had coded before.

Deriino/Deriino is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
